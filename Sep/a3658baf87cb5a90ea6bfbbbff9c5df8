You can also do DNA ancestry testing at the centre.The virtual reality goggles now available were created by Alt Reality. There will be a virtual reality tour for visitors on 25 September, which will explore various ancestors. The technology makes use of smartphones.Speakers at the conference included artist William Kentridge. He is best known for his animated drawings and is one of South Africa&#8217;s most well-established fine artists.During the discussion &#8220;Future Media: Addressing changes and development of VR industries in South Africa&#8221;, panelists spoke about their experience in animation- and related industries, as well as the challenges they faced.One of those was the high cost of hardware, especially since it changed every several months. Another challenge was that distribution of technologies such as virtual reality was not happening at scale.Rick Treweek of animation company Alt Reality had advice about changing technologies. &#8220;[If you have to create something for a client] bank on the concept.&#8220;Hardware changes fast. So don&#8217;t just develop games for Nokia, but rather games for phones.&#8221;Panelist James Gaydon of Don Doo Studios, which specialises in virtual reality, augmented reality and animation, said his company focused on providing training resources for mining companies.For example, said Gaydon, it had created a 3D virtual reality training system for Anglo American that showed what tools should be used underground.&#8220;With this model, we took the employees out of dangerous spaces they didn&#8217;t have to go underground to do the training. It makes the training less stressful, because they are not in a dangerous space,&#8221; said Gaydon.&#8220;Virtual reality is an incredible technology.&#8221;Most of the panelists agreed that they foresaw corporates using more of augmented reality versus virtual reality augmented reality is used with Pokemon Go and virtual reality is used with the film Avatar.You can use augmented reality with a smartphone and you will still see your surroundings, but with virtual reality when you put on the goggles, you are placed within a virtual world cut off from reality.Other topics discussed at the conference included &#8220;Sonic visions: Understanding new collaborations in film, design and music&#8221; and &#8220;Culture and innovation, a Pan-African Conversion&#8221;.Source: Fak&#8217;ugesiWould you like to use this article in your publication or on your website?

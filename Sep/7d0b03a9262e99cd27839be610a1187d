Nelson Mandela was the only black prisoner to be held in this &#8220;whites only&#8221; prison.A journey to the section of the Old Fort complex reserved for black men, Number Four, deepens one&#8217;s understanding of how the apartheid system made criminals of &#8220;non-whites&#8221;. Number Four was once home to prisoners such as Mahatma Ghandi, Robert Sobukwe and the students of the 1976 Soweto uprising.The grace of the Victorian-style building housing the Women&#8217;s Gaol &#8211; where the likes of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Albertina Sisulu, Fatima Meer and many other political activists were held &#8211; belies the pain and suffering that occurred within its walls.The complex housing these prisons was the place where more representatives of South Africa&#8217;s diverse communities were jailed for fighting for freedom than anywhere else in the country.For decades, thousands of prisoners streamed through the complex&#8217;s &#8220;delousing&#8221; chambers, were made to do the humiliating &#8220;Tauza&#8221; dance, were beaten and abused in the notorious Number Four prison for black men, were held for months in dirty, overcrowded conditions in the Awaiting Trial Block, were stripped of their underclothes and their dignity in the Women&#8217;s Gaol.The complex saw it all: from rebellious British soldiers who fought with the Boers at the turn of the century to striking mineworkers, Defiance Campaigners, Treason Trialists, and youths caught up in the Soweto Uprisings.Both the famous and the infamous were incarcerated here: war rebels, political activists, notorious gangsters and criminals. Activists were usually held as awaiting trial prisoners and then sent off to Robben Island or Pretoria to serve jail terms.Most of those imprisoned at the complex, however, were ordinary people arrested in their droves every day under the apartheid government&#8217;s Pass Laws restricting the movement of black people.Brewing beer &#8211; an illegal activity if you were black &#8211; also landed many women in jail. Still others were arrested for having sex across the colour bar or for homosexual sex.And black men lived in dread of Number Four, with its chilling Ekhulukhuthu (the deep hole) isolation cells.Besides the regular temporary exhibitions at Constitution Hill, two permanent exhibitions focus on the lives of two of the great 20th century fighters for the rights of the oppressed, both of whom spent time within the Old Fort.The exhibition &#8220;Gandhi: prisoner of conscience&#8221; focuses on the years Mahatma Gandhi spent in Johannesburg, from 1902 until 1914, when he left South Africa at the age of 46. It was during this time that Gandhi formulated and refined his Satyagraha or passive resistance philosophy, and was transformed from a shy lawyer into an extraordinary leader of international stature.The exhibition details the experiences that shaped his development by means of photographs, quotes, artefacts and audio material. Gandhi&#8217;s transformation is symbolised in the changes in his attire &#8211; from a besuited lawyer to rough prison garb to a simple cotton tunic on his departure for India in 1914.Gandhi said of his experiences in South Africa: &#8220;Truly speaking, it was after I went to South Africa that I became what I am now. My love for South Africa and my concern for her problems are no less than for India.&#8221;Mandela is quoted on the walls of the exhibition as saying: &#8220;The spirit of Gandhi may well be a key to human survival in the 21st century.&#8221;Housed in the cell where Nelson Mandela was held prisoner, the other permanent exhibition documents the time that Mandela spent at Robben Island as well as at the Old Fort.Mandela spent two weeks in the Awaiting Trial Block, now demolished, in December 1956, before being transferred to Pretoria for the remainder of the lengthy Treason Trial.And in August 1962, he spent a few weeks in the Old Fort hospital. He wasn&#8217;t ill, but he was kept there because of his status, and possibly because it was believed that he could more easily escape from Number Four, where the other black male prisoners were kept.Here, in his meticulously reconstructed cell, the various pictures and objects on display include a stack of wooden boxes that form but a small sample of the 76 boxes used to hold the 70 000-plus pieces of correspondence between Mandela and the prison authorities over the 27-and-a-half years of his imprisonment.He frequently wrote letters on behalf of his fellow inmates protesting against regulations disallowing books for study or complaining about the quality of the food. One letter of complaint runs to 25 pages. Some of the letters were written in Afrikaans, the mother tongue of the prison bosses.Two videos run constantly as part of the exhibition. The first one, filmed in April 1977, some 13 years into Mandela&#8217;s life sentence on Robben Island, records an official visit in which the prison authorities invited the foreign press to visit the island.The second, from December 2003, shows Mandela arriving at the newly built Constitutional Court, built below the Old Fort, and being welcomed by the then chief justice of the court, Arthur Chaskalson.For full visitor information, as well as information about special programmes, exhibitions and venue hire, visit www.constitutionhill.org.za.Would you like to use this article in your publication or on your website?

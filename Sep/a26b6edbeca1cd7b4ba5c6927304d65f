They are demanding change that will open opportunities for them to improve their socio-economic status and quality of life. We wanted to look at the subject matter of our Constitution from the point of view of young people by tapping into pop culture in order to amplify the message in a fun, persuasive, culturally relevant and informative way. Whilst the campaign is fun, it also delivers everyday realities of the constitution.WATCH: #InspiredByMyConstitution with Imraan ChristianBrand South Africa anchored the #InspiredByMyConstitution campaign on the increased exposure to socio-political dynamics playing out in the country which has given rise to youth activism through the power of hashtags such as #FeesMustFall, #BringBackOurGirls and #SayNoXenophobia.

The campaign intends to foster greater respect and appreciation for the Constitution and the role that it plays in our individual lives as well as its impact on society as a whole. Considered as the best Constitution in the world, ours is a Constitution that not only protects the rights of all its citizens, but it also speaks out for the voiceless, concluded Ntombela.Other elements of the campaign include digital banners, billboards, on-the-ground-activations, outdoor and radio.Follow the conversation on #InspiredByMyConstitution

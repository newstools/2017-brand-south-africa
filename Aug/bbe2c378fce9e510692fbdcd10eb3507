Speaking to Brand South Africa previously, Keebina said she had been to many hackathons where she was either the only female or one of a few to attend. This prompted her to approach her employer to organise a women-only hackathon. GirlCodeZA started in 2014.According to Keebine, the purpose of the hackathon is for women to connect, network and inspire each other. &#8220;We want them to see they are not alone [in the male-dominated industry] and that collaboration is key.&#8220;Just from this weekend&#8217;s event we can see there are many women in the tech industry.&#8221;There were about 20 contestants in the 2016 hackathon; this year there were more than 80. &#8220;When we started out, it was just a fun thing to do. However, it seems the contestants are a lot more serious now. They understand that there are opportunities for them to position themselves,&#8221; Keebine said.&#8220;The women are looking for bursaries and job opportunities. We asked them to send us their curriculum vitaes.&#8221;She said the hackathon allowed the contestants to innovate and create solutions for everyday problems. They had 30 hours in which to design their response. &#8220;Each team then creates a website or an app or an internet of things solution. It is up to them to decide.&#8221;Keebine explained that being able to create a solution showed companies that the developer had the skills needed in the industry.And the winner is&#8230; Rubies!!! Congrats team, well deserved! Enjoy your time in the US! #GirlCodeHack 2017 pic.twitter.com/q5PwvBMd4W Sarah Druce (@sarahkdruce) August 6, 2017Mzuku said: &#8220;It will be our first trip to the USA. We are still in shock [that we won].&#8221;She and her three teammates are studying information systems in the Commerce Faculty at the University of Cape Town. &#8220;Our department told us about the hackathon and sponsored the trip.&#8221;They will attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, believed to be the world&#8217;s largest gathering of female technologists, in October this year. The event is produced by the Anita Borg Institute.Thembi Mbatha, a contestant, said it was the first time she had taken part in this hackathon. &#8220;I came here knowing no-one. I&#8217;m a shy person,&#8221; she confessed.&#8220;As a woman in the technology industry, an event like this makes you realise you are not the only one. It&#8217;s great to see more women are growing in the industry and coming up with solutions.&#8221;She learned how to work in a team to create a solution, she said. &#8220;[The hackathon] is awesome. We also met mentors who groomed us. I&#8217;m also willing to share my skills in the future.&#8221;But hackathons should not only take place in cities, Mbatha said. &#8220;I feel hackathons should be taken to rural areas as well.&#8221;Prudence Netshituka is a systems integrator who entered the hackathon as an individual. &#8220;It was scary to enter as an individual, and also it being my first time here. I had no idea what to expect. When I arrived here, there were others who had entered as individuals.&#8221;They had to form groups and come up with an idea to solve a problem in their community. Each idea had to show how they differentiated themselves from other teams.&#8220;It&#8217;s important to have such events,&#8221; said Netshituka. &#8220;It&#8217;s important for us to network, share knowledge and to know that we [women in the industry] are not alone.&#8221;About the knowledge sharing that took place, she said: &#8220;Often when you are in the field, you tend to form a group with people who have the same knowledge as you do and you are limited to that information. Here we learned different types of technologies from each other.&#8221;Both Netshituka and Mbatha said they had a lot of fun.Gertruida Maritz, a software engineer, was one of the mentors; she helped the contestants come up with viable business ideas. &#8220;It should also fit in with the theme. The method on which each team builds their idea for example, a website or an app should be something the women are comfortable working with.&#8221;Most of the ideas were related to the medical field, she said. &#8220;There was a solution related to the voting system, too, as well as something for business how to make binding easier.&#8221;Maritz was excited to see so many passionate young women in the technology industry. &#8220;There are some passionate and very smart ladies I&#8217;ve seen here. They have this fire in their chest. It reminds me of the younger version of myself.&#8221;Mentorship and women supporting each other was a big deal she was recently supported by a woman in the accounting department in her workplace. &#8220;It can get hard in a male-dominated environment. You have a lot of emotions as a woman, but you push through it.&#8221;Whenever she had been in a difficult situation, it had been women who had helped her in her career.Hackathon participants tweeted their experiences:#GirlCodeHack These girls ne&#8230; *chokes with pride* Mama Bear is so proud pic.twitter.com/i6V3JO1WVU BontuNative (@Black_Power_M) August 6, 2017Second team Kgosigadi the app, addressing gender violence amongst other things #WomenNotObject #GirlCodeHack pic.twitter.com/MmVE21ecMo #GirlCodeHack (@GirlCode_za) August 6, 2017Fantastic ideas coming through!

The creator of a new local card game Game for Humanity that encourages kind deeds and community sharing, is aiming to inspire all South Africans to make a positive difference in their world.CD AndersonDeveloped by Capetonian social entrepreneur Marc Buhrer, Game for Humanity is styled as an easy to play community-based card game where &#8220;everyone is a winner.&#8221; Buhrer launched the game at the beginning of 2017.How the game worksA deck contains 30 cards, each including a single instruction: a simple act of kindness, giving or community generosity. Examples include things such as &#8216;buying someone a cup of coffee&#8217;, &#8216;donating clothes and blankets to a charity&#8217; or &#8216;giving a stranger a hug&#8217;.Once a player has performed the task, they pass on the card to the recipient of the gesture, so that that they can &#8216;pay it forward&#8217;.&#8220;It&#8217;s expected for them to continue with that random act of kindness, and hopefully the card has a life span of a few days, months or even years,&#8221; Buhrer told talk station, Radio 702.According to the game&#8217;s website, the intention is to &#8220;[have] fun while spreading a positive outlook and mentality between human beings irrespective of age, race, gender, religion.&#8221;The game, Buhrer said, is to counteract negativity, globally, with something that has the ability to make someone smile and think about how one simple gesture can have a world-changing effect.Listen to the Radio 702 interview with Buhrer, as he explains the game and its growing impact: The game currently has massive support among the social media community. It&#8217;s Instagram account encourages contributions from the public to show how they are using the cards to make the world a better place.This week&#8217;s #CardOfTheWeek is from the brand new #SchoolEdition!

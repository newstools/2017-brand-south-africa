We need to make domestic travel affordable but also accessible.&#8220;We want South Africans to know it is possible to travel in your own country.&#8221;The more South Africans travelled in their country, the stronger the tourism industry was. &#8220;This means we have a stronger domestic industry and international business will be more of a bonus.&#8221;&#8220;We want South Africans to be tourism ambassadors. We would like domestic tourism to be big.&#8221; #INDABA2017 pic.twitter.com/NHpLr4o9u1 SATravelTrade (@SATravelTrade) May 16, 2017The Indaba&#8217;s exhibitor&#8217;s day was held on 15 May, a day before the conference.

(@Londiwe_GGumede) May 18, 2017The Hidden Gems project was undertaken by South African Tourism and the Department of Tourism in collaboration with the Southern Africa Tourism Services Association. Ten small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) were chosen from each province to take part in a training programme before exhibiting at the Indaba.Training included mastering the ability to be ready to talk to a buyer. Sisa Ntshona, chief executive officer of South African Tourism, said at the webinar that the focus was on how to get these hidden gems to graduate to mainstream tourism. &#8220;It&#8217;s about inclusive growth. We want to bring in new players.&#8221;He encouraged other SMMEs to contact their provincial tourism authority if they wanted to stand a chance to benefit from Hidden Gems.Lebo Malepa, one of the entrepreneurs who took part in the project, said that being unique would help to get you recognised and exposed.Malepa started Lebo&#8217;s Soweto Backpackers in 1998 by selling crafts in the street. &#8220;Eventually I went to my parents and asked them, can I use my room to accommodate people (tourists), one room at a time, then the whole house eventually.&#8221;Now he has three guesthouses in Soweto. He uses some of his neighbours&#8217; houses for accommodation too. He also involved his neighbours in other things relating to his tourism business. For example, if tourists needed their washing done, he asked the women in the street to do the washing by hand.He also encouraged his neighbours to cook for tourists; because there were different cultures on his street, they cooked diverse meals.Watch Lebo Malepa talk about his tourism business in Soweto:Sources: Indaba, Indaba Daily News, Department: Tourism and Power FM 987, Soundcloud.

Founded in Australia in 2006, it is now a global event, with SleepOuts taking place in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and the UK.This global movement aims to effect positive social change for vulnerable and homeless communities. The initiative asks business leaders to spend a winter&#8217;s night on the streets, raising funds and increasing empathy for the homeless.The founding partner of the CEO SleepOut in South Africa is The Philanthropic Collection, and the inaugural event in the country took place in 2015 when 247 chief executive officers and senior company executives spent the night on Gwen Lane, Sandton. More than R26-million for the childcare organisation, Girls & Boys Town, was raised.The following year, 672 current and future business leaders spent the night on the iconic Nelson Mandela Bridge in Johannesburg City.There was also a national call to action, #SouthAfricaMustRise.

The aim is for 250 female chief executive officers or women on executive committees to participate in the event, taking place at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.Those companies who do not have female leaders can nominate another woman, but must also pledge a donation towards fundraising for the beneficiary. To participate in SheEO SleepOut, each registered person or company should pledge R100,000.The funds raised at the SheEO SleepOut will be awarded to this year&#8217;s primary beneficiary, Door of Hope. This organisation works in the area of this year&#8217;s focus pillar: shelter, especially for abandoned babies and children.The secondary beneficiaries benefit from the affiliated brands and projects. The secondary beneficiaries this year are Homeless Talk, the street newspaper; The Salvation Army; and Gift of the Givers.The CEO SleepOut initiative had its media launch on Tuesday, 25 April 2017 in Rosebank, Johannesburg.Among the guests were Prof Justice Yvonne Mokgoro, former justice at the Constitutional Court; Panyaza Lesufi, Gauteng&#8217;s MEC for education; entrepreneur and radio host Brent Lindique, who is also known as The Good Things Guy; and Leanne Manas, the SABC anchor.Yusuf Abramjee, social activist and chief ambassador of the CEO SleepOut, said the initiative had donated R50,000 towards the funeral costs of the victims of the taxi accident outside Bronkhorstspruit on 21 April 2017, in which 18 children and two adults died.Speaking at the launch of the School SleepOut 2017 in Johannesburg, Lesufi said the donation would help with funeral costs and &#8220;we are grateful&#8221;.

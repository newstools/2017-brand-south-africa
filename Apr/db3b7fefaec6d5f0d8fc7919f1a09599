Johannesburg, Wednesday 26 April 2017 </em> South Africa commemorates Freedom Day on the 27 April 2017, a day honoured and remembered for its historic occasion that took place in 1994 when South Africa achieved its first non-racial democratic elections. It is a day which marked the end of apartheid, a day, a new democratic government led by Nelson Mandela and a new constitution was born. For that, the country is admired for its remarkable history and accomplishments, in particular, obtaining its freedom and for its human rights.The country has faced positive as well as negative challenges post-1994, however, these challenges faced by our young democracy need not disintegrate the sacrifices made by of our heroes.

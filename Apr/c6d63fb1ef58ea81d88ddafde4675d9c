Nongcebo McKenzie, Ukhozi FM presenter is inspired by the South African Constitution and the fact that our right to speak the language of our choice is enshrined.Nongcebo McKenzieI m lucky enough to work for Ukhozi FM; the biggest radio station in South Africa. Also the second largest station in the world, Ukhozi FM is a national isiZulu radio station that is part of the SABC Public Broadcast Services portfolio of radio stations.I love working for the Ukhozi FM brand because as a public broadcast services station, we get to create nutritious and tasty content that empowers and educates our listeners. More than that though, I love broadcasting in isiZulu it s just so colourful for me. My job is to share information with 7.5-million listeners in a language that they love and enjoy; isiZulu. A truly beautiful language that is so rich with its many shades.That s the beauty of our African languages; whether it be Tshivenda (which I really would love to learn one day) or Afrikaans (which I find so rhythmic) or the way SeSotho speakers roll the r from the back of their throats, I find our African languages fascinating.I enjoy listening to our SABC sister station Umhlobo Wenene and I particularly enjoy their live sport commentary because I love the isiXhosa analogiesI m glad that I live in a country with a Constitution that guarantees the right to speak all our 11 official languages and makes them all equal. The South African Constitution provides for 11 official languages in our beautiful country: Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu, sePedi, seSotho, seTswana, siSwati, tshiVenda and xiTsonga.Section 6 of the Constitution states that everyone has the right to use the language and participate in the cultural life of his or her choice though no one may do so in a manner inconsistent with any provision of the Bill of Rights.Ngiyaziqhenya ngokuba ngowaseNingizimu Afrika. Ngiyaziqhenya ngoMthethosisekelo wezwe lethu, meaning, I beat my chest with pride because I am a child of South Africa. I stand tall when I know that ours is the best Constitution in the world .I am inspired by my Constitution.Would you like to use this article in your publication or on your website?

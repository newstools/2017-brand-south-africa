Brand South Africa has partnered with Sunday Times Generation Next on this year&#8217;s Sunday Times Generation Next youth marketing conference, which looks at how youth affect marketing and advertising, and explores how they can drive the growth of local brands.Mathiba MolefeBrand South Africa and Sunday Times Generation Next host the 13th instalment of the annual Sunday Times Generation Next youth marketing conference on 11 May, at The Pavilion at the Sandton Convention Centre.Sunday Times Generation Next was established in 2004 to keep track of how youth interact with, and respond to, brands in order to help brands cater to their needs and wants. It offers marketers an in-depth look at the buying and consumption habits of people between the ages of eight and 23.A wide range of South African brands will be represented at the conference, which will help local brands market themselves better to people in this age group.In turn, this will help to raise the profile of local brands among the youth and provide local alternatives to cater to their needs by connecting the customer directly to the producer.One of the event&#8217;s main objectives, through its youth brand preference and consumer behaviour survey, is to teach young people about brand purchases. It highlights the many opportunities that South Africa has to offer and encourages them to support local brands.This ties in tidily with Brand South Africa&#8217;s ongoing efforts to promote and enhance the country&#8217;s nation brand and to build pride and patriotism in South Africans.Youth between the ages of eight and 23 account for an average of more than R120-billion of South Africa&#8217;s yearly expenditure, according to Sunday Times Generation Next, making this demographic of great significance to local business and marketers.Join usThe Sunday Times Generation Next youth marketing conference offers marketers insight into the perceptions and consumption habits of the youth.

Read more about his initiative, Champion South Africa.Melissa Javan South Africa will become a champion nation when the government, business and civil society synchronise their efforts towards the goal of becoming individual and collective champions. This is according to Ashraf Garda, who is the co-founder of Champion South Africa.&#8220;Champion people build champion people and only champion people build champion nations,&#8221; he says.The movement, launched in November 2015, is currently asking: What are you doing to build your country?Several local leaders, such as Vusi Thembekayo, Khanyi Dhlomo and Yvonne Chaka Chaka, were chosen to be part of Champion South Africa, so they too can spread the message and urge more people to become champions.Brand South Africa sat down for a question and answer session with Garda about Champion South Africa.Watch Ashraf Garda motivate an audience to help build Champion South Africa:Ashraf Garda: The Champion South Africa concept started after I had many conversations with people on the talk show I host on Radio SA FM. [We would] talk about their aspirations and moving the country to another level.I kept hearing &#8220;If you have an idea, just start with it.&#8221;My son, Zaahid, is in marketing and owns a start-up called Student Photography. We talked about my idea and worked together to start Champion South Africa. We are the founders.AG: Firstly, as Champion South Africa we want to change the mindset of South Africans. We currently have a mid-table mindset, but we want to change it to the &#8220;okay is not good enough&#8221; mindset.Collectively and individually everyone should be champions in whatever they are doing. This is so that the country will have more champions. The country needs us to become a champion nation. That&#8217;s why you need the change in the mindset of the people.Secondly, we have to change the mindset of the country. Champion is a noun; we want the world to think about a champion nation when people think about South Africa.There&#8217;s no world cup of nations there is no competition like that. If there ever was one, then the vision would be that the United Nations secretary-general would in the future announce South Africa as a champion nation.To achieve this, we need to increase the number of champions we have in the country.Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters is congratulated as 2017 Miss South Africa in March this year:This is @DemiLeighNP SA&#8217;s newest champion #MissSA2017 @Official_MissSA ! #ChampionSouthAfrica @MIssKunene pic.twitter.com/4swFibmAdD ChampionSouthAfrica (@ChampionSAfrica) March 26, 2017AG: We decided we would have a campaign that would last a few weeks.

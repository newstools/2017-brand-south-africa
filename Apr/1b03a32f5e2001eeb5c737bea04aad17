And he is now offering South Africans a chance to sample his interpretations of fast food staples at his new restaurant, which opened in Pretoria&#8217;s newly revamped Menlyn Maine shopping mall on 1 April 2017.Guy Fieri&#8217;s Kitchen + Bar is in the Maine&#8217;s R4-billion hotel and casino development. It joins a range of other quality gourmet restaurants, including Forti Grill, by South African chef Fortunato Mazzone, and Something&#8217;s Cooking, owned by J&#8217;Something (Joao da Fonseca) from top local band MiCasa, who is a passionate foodie himself, blending the tastes of his home country Portugal and Mzansi.Watch J&#8217;Something cook up something special on his Youtube channel below:Fieri&#8217;s South African endeavour joins his other popular restaurants around the world, including high profile venues on Las Vegas&#8217;s Sunset Strip and in Times Square in New York City, as well as 50 other branded food outlets, including Guy&#8217;s Burger Joints, serving on the entire luxury tour fleet of Carnival Cruise Liners.Notable for his often controversial embracing of so-called guilty pleasure eating, Fieri&#8217;s restaurants offer diners a chance to indulge in gourmet quality hamburgers, signature sandwiches and one-of-a-kind cocktails. Fieri told Times LIVE before the Pretoria opening that guests would enjoy only the best &#8220;real deal, scratch-made food, killer cocktails and a rocking good time&#8221;.The menu includes, of course, his legendary signature dish, the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger.While not for the faint-hearted nor health-conscious, Fieri&#8217;s award-winning reputation for, as he calls it, &#8220;not fast food, but good food served quickly&#8221;, guarantees healthy portions served with side orders of classiness and value-for-money.&#8220;South Africans work hard for their money,&#8221; he told Times LIVE. &#8220;They deserve to be able to take their family out for good food and a good time. We&#8217;re bringing the heat and excitement of Flavourtown but at local market prices so it&#8217;s accessible to everyone.&#8221;And Fieri hasn&#8217;t forgotten to include some local flavour in his offerings.&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to do South Africa, you got to have some scratch-made rubbed and sauced peri-peri chicken wings, right? You&#8217;re not going to find grilled springbok loin from Mokopane in New York City but after trying it in South Africa, I may have to change that.&#8221;Who is Guy Fieri?Fieri began his food career making and selling pretzels on street corners, which financed his culinary studies in France.Together with a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in hotel management and almost 20 years of experience in restaurant management, he found sudden fame when he won the Food Network&#8217;s 2016 Next Food Star reality show contest.

It asked entrepreneurs what the NSBC could focus on more. &#8220;The number one answer (was) access to finance. The survey also said that the majority of the people who applied for funding last year went to banks and the government.&#8221;The challenge of most entrepreneurs was that they did not know about other lenders, she said.Hundreds of lending products available According to Menzies, there are 350 lending products in South Africa. &#8220;A lot of these lenders do not meet their KPIs (key performance indicators) because they are struggling to find SMMEs to whom they can lend.&#8220;They receive large volumes of loan applications, but only find a small percentage to lend to. They have a shortage of viable ideas. They&#8217;re lending to get a return,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They need to finance ready and bankable businesses.&#8221;Finfind Easy, she explained, was a website that connected entrepreneurs who were looking for funding with lenders. It was free and easy to use. The initiative is sponsored by USAid, the Small Enterprise Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development. The site was updated daily, and included government grants and loan offerings.&#8220;It&#8217;s the only website of its kind in the country. We already have 5,000 users.&#8221;There were 64 funds available for starting a business, 109 funds available for growing a start-up, 26 funds available for completing a contract, 73 funds available for buying equipment, and 180 funds available for expanding a business, Menzies said.It meets your needs The site asked questions of the user such as &#8220;How much do you need, how long have you run your business, what is the funding for, and what is your average turnover?&#8221;And there were no right or wrong answers. &#8220;If you are not profitable, there are funds for you. If you don&#8217;t have all the documents, the system will help you,&#8221; Menzies said. &#8220;Your company number is needed.&#8221;Small business owners could also learn about finance on the website, for example the different types of lenders and the different types of finance available.You can access the website, here.Would you like to use this article in your publication or on your website?

The Reserve Bank and the National Treasury form the monetary authority in South Africa.

It recognises the need to pursue balanced economic policies that enhance both development and growth.The Bank is managed by a board of 14 directors representing commerce, finance, industry and agriculture. Seven directors are elected by the Bank&#8217;s shareholders. The President of South Africa appoints the governor, three deputy governors and three other directors to the board.The SARB&#8217;s management, powers and functions are governed by the South African Reserve Bank Act of 1989.The Reserve Bank implements South Africa&#8217;s monetary policy and regulates the supply (availability) of money by influencing its cost.Monetary policy is set by the Reserve Bank&#8217;s monetary policy committee, which works within a flexible inflation-targeting framework.The Bank undertakes national and international transactions on behalf of the state, and acts for the government in transactions with the International Monetary Fund.The Bank is the custodian of the greater part of South Africa&#8217;s gold and other foreign exchange reserves.The Reserve Bank controls the South African Mint Company, and issues banknotes printed by the South African Bank Note Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank.Visit the Reserve Bank&#8217;s website, where you will find information on legislation, the bank&#8217;s mandate, monetary policy, inflation targeting and reserves management.Also see our article on South Africa&#8217;s National Treasury, or visit the National Treasury&#8217;s website.Reviewed: 28 January 2013Would you like to use this article in your publication or on your website?

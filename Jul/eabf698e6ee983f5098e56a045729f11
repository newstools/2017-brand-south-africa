Johannesburg, Thursday 20 July Brand South Africa, in partnership with Brand Finance and Brand Africa, will on Wednesday 26 July, announce the Top 50 South African commercial brands.Announced annually since 2013, the top 50 South African most valuable brands are evaluated by Brand Finance at three different levels. These include: branded business value, brand valuation and brand value.

This approach involves estimating the future revenue attributable to a brand and calculating a royalty rate that would be charged for the use of the brand. These South African companies help to fly the country s flag high domestically and internationally. In today s market, it is crucial to stand apart from the crowd.

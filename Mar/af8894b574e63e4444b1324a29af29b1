The scenic Route 62, between Cape Town and Oudtshoorn, has been named by CNN Travel as the world&#8217;s best road trip destination. Here are five must-see stops along the legendary Western Cape route.A CNN Travel poll, as voted by tourists and travel journalists, puts the scenic and fun-filled road between Cape Town and Oudtshoorn, Route 62, as the top road trip destination in the world, beating out a host of legendary global grand tours including Canada&#8217;s Alcan Highway and the Ticlio Pass in Peru.While Route 62 primarily connects Cape Town to Oudtshoorn, and ultimately the Garden Route further east, a host of attractions and activities along the road, and off its beaten path, incorporate smaller towns in the area, including Montagu, Humansdorp and parts of the Klein Karoo.CNN calls the road &#8220;a journey to the unexpected&#8221;, with something for everyone, highlighting the natural beauty of the region&#8217;s &#8220;fauna, rivers, valleys and plains&#8221; and the diversity of activities available that turn the seemingly mundane commute into an adventure.Everything and anything from wine tours and safari drives, heritage and art tours, hiking and mountain climbing, water sport and fishing, or just quiet contemplation while watching one of kind views with a cold drink and a good meal, Route 62 has it all.Ronnies Sex ShopThe legendary roadside bar, midway on the route, is a quirky and fun stop, popular among tourists and regular road warriors alike.Legend has it that in the late 1970s, local farmer Ronald Price opened a roadside produce stall, complete with a proudly handpainted sign. Friends of Ronnie mischievously amended the sign to its now infamous title, and convinced Ronnie to turn the stall into a coffee shop-bar for bikers and other travellers.Forty years later, and the quirkiness of the place didn t end at the sign. Inside, the bar is completely covered with travellers&#8217; graffiti, donated neckties, bras and other random bric-a-brac, ceiling to floor. Ronnies includes a full restaurant, overnight accommodation, communal pool with vista views of famous Karoo sunsets and good old-fashioned peace and quiet from the busy road, with just a touch of good-natured anarchy.ZA Route 62 Oudtshoorn Cango Caves & more https://t.co/AWzTXTPzPA pic.twitter.com/AIt9CuL3ri Overlandtour (@overlandtourDE) March 2, 2017Route 62: Ronnies Sex Shop https://t.co/kGE3TBtLAa pic.twitter.com/ApX9em4r20 Sabine Ludwig (@sl4lifestyle) February 9, 2017Drive Route 62 Western Cape&#8230;.and leave your name on the wall of Ronnies Sex Shop&#8230;best cheese and onion toasties ever&#8230;.. pic.twitter.com/rMH6Njparg Ross Nicholas (@rossrenee1) October 22, 2016The world&#8217;s longest wine routeIncorporating hundreds of small, up-and-coming winemakers and larger, more established wine farms, Route 62&#8217;s world class wine route centres on the industry&#8217;s defacto capital the town of Robertson where not only can you visit the Klipdrift brandy plant and see how this South African magic is made, but you get to taste some of the country&#8217;s award-winning wines.

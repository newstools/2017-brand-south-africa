South Africa&#8217;s NSPCA has been protecting animals for more than six decades and now calls on the public to help it rid our neighbourhoods of dog fighting. Support its crowd funding initiative and give its Special Investigations Unit the strength it needs to make a telling difference.Mathiba MolefeSouth Africa&#8217;s SPCA, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, has been working to protect animals for more than 60 years.Its ongoing efforts to safeguard the welfare of animals have largely relied on the support the organisation gets from the public.The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) has now directed a large portion of its resources to the battle against dog fighting in South Africa. The organisation will be expanding its Special Investigations Unit to bolster efforts to stop dog fighting.The unit conducts undercover work countrywide to find dogs that are being used for illegal dog fighting, conducting raids and rescues where necessary.&#8220;Dog fighting is a subject that people should be outraged about,&#8221; said Wendy Willson, a senior inspector and manager of the unit.&#8220;In addition to the horrific suffering of the animals involved, the crime has a devastating effect on the people, children and societies where it is happening and the communities who tolerate its existence.&#8221;Help end dog fightingTo help the unit continue rescuing dogs that have been caught in the cruelty of dog fighting, the NSPCA appeals to business and the public to help it raise the funds it needs.If you or anyone you know would like to help the NSPCA and its Special Investigations Unit end dog fighting you can donate to its crowd-funding initiative created with help from Different.Org, a crowd-funding platform for NGOs and initiatives aimed at benefitting society.You can also help the organisation by reporting any suspicious activity in your area to the NSPCA via these contact details:Your identity is protected and you can remain anonymous.Play Your PartEveryone can make a positive difference in their own way.

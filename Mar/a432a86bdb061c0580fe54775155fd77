It also includes unity in diversity.&#8221;The walk, a demonstration of unity amongst all that live in South Africa, was aimed at promoting tolerance amongst everyone who calls the country their home and serves as a call to eliminate xenophobia.&#8220;Today we want to stand together and say, we affirm this constitutionalism and that everybody has a part to play,&#8221; Gumede explained.Following a quick warm-up and opening remarks by MC and actor, Sello Maake Ka-Ncube, the crowd set off on a walk through Johannesburg&#8217;s inner city.People then branched off on the various routes: a one kilometre, a five kilometre or an eight kilometre for those felt like taking in more of the city s scenery.This year&#8217;s walk was the fourth instalment of the annual event and was attended by more than 2 000 people looking to celebrate diversity and to promote tolerance amongst everyone living in South Africa.Jeanny Morulane, the general manager of marketing and communications at Constitution Hill, said that she was very pleased by the number of people who attended the event.&#8220;This is a very important event,&#8221; Morulane said. &#8220;Because we&#8217;re remembering our Constitution, we&#8217;re celebrating our Constitution at a very relevant space here at Constitution Hill.&#8220;We were very pleased with the turnout. It was a mix, a representation of all of South Africa, all races, all colours, all nationalities. So it was a really nice gathering for everyone.&#8220;It&#8217;s showing that our democracy is indeed getting firmer.&#8221;South Africa&#8217;s Constitution, considered by many as one of the most progressive in the world, values freedom of choice and encourages us all to strive for greatness while respecting and valuing cultural and linguistic diversity.Stand up and be counted &#8220;It&#8217;s about you, it&#8217;s about myself, it&#8217;s about your neighbour, it&#8217;s about every single person playing their part to do the right thing,&#8221; Gumede said.&#8220;Today is really about doing the right thing and embracing that which is the foundation, not only of our democracy, but the foundation on which the South Africa of today was built.&#8221;In order for South Africa, and indeed Africa as a whole, to fulfil its extraordinary potential we all need to come together and work towards a common goal.It is for this reason that Brand South Africa calls on everybody living in South Africa to play their part in maintaining a society that values the rights of those who call the country their home.&#8220;Unity becomes more meaningful and more powerful when we acknowledge our differences,&#8221; Morulane said.&#8220;Our differences are what make us such a beautiful collective.&#8221;Would you like to use this article in your publication or on your website?

Mathebula spoke about the essential elements of building a sustainable brand identifying &#8220;touch points&#8221; that built strong connections between a brand and its audience.While the creation of a strong brand identity idea was vital, Mathebula pointed out the importance of the successful implementation of those ideas.

There was a reason why some car companies seemed lifeless compared to stronger car brands that used emotion to highlight their selling points &#8220;There is humanity to these companies.&#8221;Mabena also pointed out how individual, personal brands worked so well, citing the example of pop singer Beyonc and her relationship with her fans. Fans felt like they were part of that brand, they were emotionally invested in the person and influential in the longevity of the individual&#8217;s brand.Honesty: Companies must look at their brand perceptions and be honest about what they wanted to communicate. Once that true purpose was found, companies needed to stick to that ideal; they also needed to be consistent with the overall authentic messaging. &#8220;Honest brands with honest promises capture hearts and minds, and then wallets,&#8221; Mabena explained.Innovative branding: Find the real reason your brand worked or didn&#8217;t work and capitalise on the strongest points, while innovating ways to overcome negative perceptions. Overhaul the touch points in your brand messaging, change and review mediums you use to communicate with customers.Be the customer: &#8220;Walking in the customer&#8217;s shoes&#8221;, Mabena explained, gave you a better understanding of your brand perception is it viewed as real and authentic? Is it &#8220;cool&#8221;? Are you communicating the right ideas to consumers using the right channels?A good barometer for finding the &#8220;realness&#8221; of your brand was asking if what you were communicating created a positive emotional response. &#8220;If it makes you smile, then it will make your customer smile.&#8221; Ultimately, he pointed out, you should never underestimate the humanity of your public.Mabena concluded his good-natured and anecdote-filled presentation by highlighting what lessons brands could learn from a company such as Apple and the philosophy of its founder, the late Steve Jobs:Being an innovator in everything you did as an individual or as an organisation from your products to your brand building, from your messages and the mediums you chose to communicate those messages could make you a leader, not a follower.Source: Brand South AfricaWould you like to use this article in your publication or on your website?

Sites are nominated by national governments and are voted for by the MAB council, but they remain under the sovereign jurisdiction of the states in which they are located.The status of such sites is internationally recognised. The official launch of the Garden Route biosphere reserve will take place later in the year.The Garden Route biosphere reserve, located within the Cape Floristic biodiversity hotspot region, has a total area of 698,363ha and the population sits at 450,624 people.The area includes the Tsitsikamma, Goukamma and Robberg Marine protected areas, Wilderness Lake Ramsar site, Garden Route National Park and two components of the Cape Floral Region Protected Areas World Heritage site: the Nelson Bay Cave and the Langkloof Valley, the latter being critically endangered.&#8220;The Knysna estuary is of great importance for the conservation of this biodiversity,&#8221; said Unesco. &#8220;The eastern part of the biosphere reserve is characterised by the presence of wetlands in which farming practices and urban development could have a negative impact. Faunal diversity includes large mammals such as elephants, rhino and buffalo.&#8221;Sites across the globe have also been included in Unesco&#8217;s list, some crossing national borders and spilling over two countries:Share your #PHOTOS of @UNESCO Biosphere Reserves on Wikipedia to inspire the world .

Bringing the character to life on ice, he said, was truly a dream come true.Scar was a really cool character, Konrad said, and because he was evil, he got to be aggressive on the ice, which he enjoyed.Yolande plays numerous Disney characters featured in the show.After seeing Disney on Ice at Montecasino in Johannesburg a number of years ago, the pair decided to audition. They got the gig in 2009.Yolande said it changed their lives. Not only did they get to skate together, but they also travelled the globe, representing the country as they went.&#8220;It&#8217;s been a wonderful journey. We are about 40 skaters and 15 crew members that travel the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have become one big family on tour. We work together, eat together, shop together. We do everything together.&#8221;Both Konrad and Yolande started skating when young, at four and seven years old, respectively.Yolande described skating as a lot of fun and encouraged young people to keep practising. &#8220;Work hard on your performance skills; that&#8217;s most important.&#8221;From 2000 to 2004, Konrad was South Africa&#8217;s national junior ice skating champion, a title he regained in 2007. He represented South Africa in international competitions such as Four Continents and Junior Worlds.Classic Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy appear in the Wonderful World of Disney on Ice, alongside the new generation including Simba, Timon and Pumbaa.Others from Pixar&#8217;s Finding Dory, and Disney&#8217;s Tangled also join the show.There will also be performances in Durban for the first time.
